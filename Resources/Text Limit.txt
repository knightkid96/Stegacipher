Factors Affecting the Message Length:
1. Image Format:
Lossless Formats (e.g., PNG, BMP):
These formats retain all pixel data, making them ideal for steganography. The maximum message size is directly proportional to the image size and its bit depth.
Lossy Formats (e.g., JPEG):
Due to compression, some data may be lost or altered, reducing the capacity to embed a message reliably.
2. Image Dimensions:
Larger images have more pixels, which means more capacity for embedding data.
Example: A 100x100 image has 10,000 pixels. If you use 1 byte per pixel, the maximum message size is approximately 10 KB.
3. Color Depth:
Images with higher bit depth (e.g., 24-bit RGB images) can hold more data:
24-bit images: 3 bytes per pixel (1 byte for each Red, Green, and Blue channel). This allows for more data to be stored compared to an 8-bit grayscale image.
4. Steganographic Method:
Techniques like Least Significant Bit (LSB) allow embedding a few bits per pixel (e.g., the least significant bit of each color channel in an RGB image).
The number of bits altered per pixel determines the message size and the visual quality of the stego image.
5. Compression:
Embedding data in compressed images (like JPEG) may result in a lower capacity due to compression artifacts and losses.
Typical Limitations:
Capacity Formula (Approximation):

Quality vs. Capacity:

Increasing the amount of embedded data can distort the image, making it visually suspicious.
Practical Limits:

Real-world tools often limit the message size to a fraction of the maximum capacity (e.g., 50-80%) to maintain visual integrity.
In Conclusion:
The message length is not fixed but rather limited by the image size, format, and technique used. A good rule of thumb is that larger, high-quality, uncompressed images can embed longer messages, while smaller or compressed images (e.g., JPEG) have reduced capacity.
